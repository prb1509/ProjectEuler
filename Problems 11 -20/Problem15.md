One can think of the problem as a simple coin flipping scenario. Flip heads: move right. Flip tails: move down.\
Ultimately the route must end in the bottom right corner, so there must necessarily be 20 heads and 20 tails each. \
In other words, we have a sequence (say HTHTHT...) of length 40 with 20 H and 20 T.\
There are $\dfrac{40!}{20!20!} = 137846528820$ such sequences.
